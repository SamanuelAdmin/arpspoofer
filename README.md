<strong>ARP spoofing</strong> is a network attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local network. 
The goal is to associate the attacker's MAC (Media Access Control) address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. 
Once the attacker is linked to the victimâ€™s IP, they can intercept, modify, or block traffic intended for that device.
